CHECKLIST WHEN ADDING A FEATURE :
-> add config if necessary
-> add the feature
-> edit the README if necessary
-> add to the update log
-> remove from TODO

0.4.0 (0.32):
-> ADD THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE LOADOUT PREVIEW TO ONLY APPEAR ONCE ON TAC SCREEN INIT
-> ADD LOADOUT PREVIEW TO HMD
-> make the navballs color dynamic with the theme
-> add label mfd color setting
-> ensure the custom controls are not activated when not in flight
-> add a check to deactivate the target screen if its created before the boot animation is done
-> loadout preview doesn't handle weapons with a loading stage properly, like the door guns on the ibis / the maximum cap changes depending on the ammo reserve
-> fix exceptions when there are no weapon slots on the plane

TODO :
-> make the mod compatible with QOL mod
-> same with sling, adapt it for the wpon screen
-> slightly mov the EW indicator to the left on the vortex, move the ir indicator slightly to the right too
-> add functionalty to see if a targeted unit is being targeted by a friendly missile
-> a button to unmark targets that don't hav a known datalink position
-> more generally, target list handling
-> the target interceptor doesn't work when jammed


NICE TO HAVE :
-> make it so the weapon selector automatically skips over fully expended weapons
-> update uniticonrecolor so that the colors show even when not in a plane yet
-> investigate the POV up format encountered by some users
-> more generally, find a new way to work with "non-standard" buttons
-> add main menu patch reset, no need to restart the game
