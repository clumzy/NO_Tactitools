CHECKLIST WHEN ADDING A FEATURE :
-> add config if necessary
-> add the feature
-> edit the README if necessary
-> add to the update log
-> remove from TODO

NEXT UPDATE LOG :
-> ADD THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE LOADOUT PREVIEW TO ONLY APPEAR ONCE ON TAC SCREEN INIT

TODO :
-> ADD LOADOUT PREVIEW TO HMD
-> loadout preview doesn't handle weapons with a loading stage properly, like the door guns on the ibis / the maximum cap changes depending on the ammo reserve
-> same with sling, adapt it for the wpon screen
-> add a check to deactivate the target screen if its created before the boot animation is done
-> make it so the weapon selector automatically skips over fully expended weapons
-> ensure the custom controls are not activated when not in flight
-> make the navballs color dynamic with the theme
-> add label mfd color setting
-> add main menu patch reset, no need to restart the game

NICE TO HAVE :
-> update uniticonrecolor so that the colors show even when not in a plane yet
-> investigate the POV up format encountered by some users
-> more generally, find a new way to work with "non-standard" buttons
