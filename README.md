# Nuclear Option Tactitools

A **very WIP** mod for game Nuclear Option.
Comprises the following components :
- A module for creating new joystick inputs, thanks to some simple ReWired reverse engineering
- A module for creating new UI elements, on the HUD, Flight HUD and flight instruments
- An interception vector displayed on the tactical screen for single mobile targets
- The ability to save and recall a target group for later use
- A decoupling of the different countermeasure and weapon slots switching, each has its own button now

More to follow soon !
