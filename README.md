# ‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuclear Option Tactical Tools ‚ò¢Ô∏è
---
## About
Nuclear Option Tactical Tools is an immersion and QoL focused gameplay mod. 

The mod aims to enhance cockpit immersion and reduce repetitive UI actions without automating core combat mechanics, with a heavy focus on ensuring non-mod users are not at a disadvantage and a *vanilla* feel for the new functionalities. 
Every component of the mod is togglable, and you can use your keyboard and HOTAS to interact with some of the new functionalities.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the mod as much as I enjoy developing it, feel free to hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/909034158205059082/1387441277414539316) !

Fly safe,
George

- Press F1 in-game to display the configuration menu
- If the configuration menu doesn't show up, follow these steps :
  - Go to *Nuclear Option/BepInEx/config* and open *BepInEx.cfg*
  - Set **HideManagerGameObject** to **true**

## Configuring the mod

### How to activate/deactivate and configure features
- Open Configuration Manager once the main menu of Nuclear Option is loaded
- Click on the *NOTT* tab
- Hovering your mouse over each setting will give you more details
- Disable/Enable the components you want, and edit their settings if appliable
- **RESTART THE WHOLE GAME** (activated mod components are patched on game start)

### Advanced configuration (Unit Icon Recolor and Artificial Horizon)
You can configure the Unit Icon Recolor and Artificial Horizon using text files located in the mod's folder.
As time goes on I will allow more features to be precisely configured using text files.
- Open the *config* folder located in *Nuclear Option/BepInEx/plugins/NOTT*
- Open the two text files and follow the instructions in the comments (comments start with *//*)

### How to setup the mod to use your HOTAS and keyboard
The process is a bit convoluted, I admit. Since the game is using ReWired for its inputs, I had to reverse engineer some obfuscated code and I haven't managed to leverage the ingame bindings menu for now. However what I have for now should work in a stable and surefire way !

#### Setting up HOTAS buttons
- Go to the ingame bindings menu
- Bind a new control using the button you want to use
- Write down the number of the button, and the name of the peripheral (don't forget to remove the binding you used to get the button number)
- Open Configuration Manager and the NOTT tab
- Input the name of the peripheral and its button (only the number) in the relevant settings
- Repeat as needed
- **RESTART THE GAME**

</details>

#### Setting up HOTAS hats
- Go to the ingame bindings menu
- Bind a new control using the hat you want to use
  - You'll get an output in the format **Hat {number} {direction}**
- Write down the number of the hat, its direction (only *up, left, down* and *right* are supported for now), and the name of the peripheral (don't forget to remove the binding you used to get the hat info)
- Open Configuration Manager and the NOTT tab
- Input the name of the peripheral in the relevant setting
- Input the hat control in the following format : **h_{number}_{direction}**
- Repeat as needed
- **RESTART THE GAME**

</details>

#### Setting up keyboard inputs
- Go to the ingame bindings menu
- Bind a new control using the keyboard input you want to use
- Write down the input the game has detected
  - This is important if you're not using a QWERTY keyboard, the input displayed will likely not be the same as what's on your keyboard
- Look up its relevant KeyCode (Unity's way of storing keyboard inputs) [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html)
- Open Configuration Manager and the NOTT tab*
- The name of the peripheral in the relevant setting **must be Keyboard**
- Input the key code you got earlier in the relevant setting
- **RESTART THE GAME**

## Common issues

### My settings haven't been applied
Restart the game, **I BEG YOU**

### My peripheral is not recognized
Sometimes the internal name of a peripheral is not the same as the one displayed in the menus.
- Ensure you have activated Debug mode in the NOTT settings
- Open the BepInEx log file, called *LogOutput.log*, located in *Nuclear Option/BepInEx/*
- Look for lines that start with *[IC] Controller connected :*
- Write down the name of the controller, if it is different than the one you see ingame, this is the one you must use in the NOTT config menu
